The S-Interface (previously OTACS) has been built as a modular system in C#. It is a communal software development project, where anybody can contribute modules with specific functionality. These modules are called plug-ins and need to conform to certain programming guidelines that are spelled out in the Plug-in Tutorial. Functionally speaking, the plug-ins are of two major varieties: (a) sensor channels, and (b) algorithm implementations. In its current plug-in library, the S-Interface features three sensor acquisition channels and four algorithms.
